                        At Akari, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy
                        Policy explains what information we collect and how we
                        use it when you visit our website or use the Akari

                    <h2>1. Local Usage</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you are running Akari locally on your device, no data
                        is sent to any of our servers. All interactions,
                        including the use of cookies and account data, remain
                        entirely on your local device. Vercel Web Analytics and
                        any other external services will not be invoked in the
                        local environment.
                    </p>

                    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

                            usage. No personal data is collected or stored
